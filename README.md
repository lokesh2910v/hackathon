# üí° Project : Learn to Earn Web Platform

A decentralized learning platform where users **complete quizzes or tasks** and earn **Aptos tokens** as rewards. Designed to promote education through incentivization, all progress and rewards are securely recorded using **blockchain technology**.

> üèÜ This project is submitted as part of a **Hackathon**. GitHub repository contains full source code, smart contracts, and setup instructions.

## üìú Abstract

The **Learn to Earn Web Platform** revolutionizes online education by integrating **blockchain** and **crypto rewards** to encourage active learning. Users participate in educational activities like quizzes and tasks, and upon completion, they earn **Aptos tokens**, which are stored and tracked on-chain. The platform is built on the **Aptos Blockchain**, known for its scalability, speed, and use of the secure **Move language**.

By leveraging the **Aptos SDK**, we seamlessly connect with the **Petra Wallet** for user login, secure wallet-based authentication, and reward transactions. Each completed task is logged on the blockchain to ensure transparency, immutability, and fairness. Smart contracts written in **Move** govern the reward logic and token transfers, ensuring a trustless reward mechanism without intermediaries.

To enhance reliability, **user profiles and authentication** are stored securely in a PostgreSQL database. The hybrid architecture ensures off-chain data like profiles and credentials remain private, while all reward-related data is stored immutably on-chain.

This project not only promotes decentralized education but also demonstrates the real-world utility of blockchain in incentivizing learning. With **Petra Wallet integration**, task-to-token flow, and tamper-proof reward distribution, our platform paves the way for a new era of transparent, blockchain-powered e-learning.

## üß† Project Explanation

### Why Blockchain?
- Prevents tampering with user progress or rewards.
- Transparent and immutable tracking of tasks and achievements.
- Direct, secure token distribution without intermediaries.

### Aptos Blockchain:
- Fast, scalable Layer 1 blockchain.
- Smart contracts written in **Move** language.
- Petra Wallet used for authentication and transactions.
- Aptos SDK (JavaScript) used for seamless integration.

### Smart Contracts:
- Deployed on Aptos Devnet/Testnet.
- Validate quiz completions and trigger token rewards.
- All task and reward data stored on-chain.

### Security:
- Immutable data storage on-chain.
- Wallet-based authentication prevents spoofing.

## üîó Transaction Flow

1. User connects Petra Wallet.
2. Completes a quiz or task.
3. Task completion is verified and stored on Aptos blockchain.
4. Aptos tokens are rewarded via a smart contract.
5. Wallet reflects new token balance.
